# Revising MERN 🚀

This repository is my personal journey of revising and mastering the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with supporting tools and technologies. Every week I explored new concepts, built small projects, and deepened my understanding of full-stack development.

## 📅 Weekly Learning Journey

### 🧩 Week 1 — HTML Fundamentals

* Basic structure of an HTML document (`doctype`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
* Common semantic tags: headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms.
* Building simple pages and understanding the DOM tree.
* Best practices for accessibility (alt text, semantic markup).

### 🎨 Week 2 — CSS Basics

* Selectors, specificity, and the cascade.
* Box model (margin, border, padding, content).
* Layout fundamentals: display, position, floats, and simple responsive techniques.
* Introduction to Flexbox for horizontal/vertical layout and simple responsive designs.

### ⚙️ Week 3 — JavaScript Basics

* JS syntax, data types, variables (`let`, `const`), and operators.
* Control flow: conditions, loops, functions.
* DOM manipulation: selecting elements, handling events, updating the page.
* Basics of asynchronous JS: callbacks, `fetch` for simple API calls.
* Small interactive project: a to-do list or a simple form validator.

### 📖 Week 4 — Node.js Basics

* Setting up a Node.js environment.
* Understanding modules (`fs`, `http`, `path`).
* Creating a simple HTTP server and basic CLI scripts.

### ⚡ Week 5 — Express.js Fundamentals

* Middleware, routing, and error handling.
* Working with JSON bodies and form data.

### 🗄️ Week 6 — Databases with MongoDB

* NoSQL concepts and when to use them.
* Connecting Node.js with MongoDB using Mongoose.
* Designing schemas and performing CRUD operations.

### 🌐 Week 7 — SQL & PostgreSQL

* Relational database basics (tables, keys, joins).
* Writing SQL queries (DDL, DML).
* Integrating PostgreSQL with Node.js (pg client).

### ☁️ Week 7 (Part 2) — MongoDB Advanced

* Indexing and query optimization.
* Aggregation pipelines.
* Modeling relationships in MongoDB (embedding vs referencing).

### ⚛️ Week 8 — React Basics

* JSX, functional components, props, and state.
* Component composition, event handling, and lists.

### 🖼️ Week 9 — React Deep Dive

* React Router for SPA navigation.
* Context API for global state.
* Controlled components and form handling.

### 📱 Week 10 — Single Page Applications (SPA)

* How SPAs work and client-side routing.
* SEO considerations and server-side rendering (overview).

### 🎨 Week 11 — Reusable React Components

* Component patterns: composition, higher-order components (HOC), render props.
* Organizing component libraries and reusability.

### 💅 Week 13 — Tailwind CSS

* Utility-first CSS approach.
* Responsive design rules with Tailwind classes.
* Creating custom themes and small design systems.

### 📝 Week 14 — TypeScript Basics

* Typing primitives, objects, arrays, and functions.
* Interfaces, types, and generics.
* Gradual migration strategies from JS to TS.

### 🔐 Week 15 — Security

* Common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection) and mitigation.
* Securing Express apps with Helmet and CORS.
* Password hashing with bcrypt and authentication basics.

### 📡 Week 16 — WebSockets & Real-Time

* Real-time communication with Socket.IO / WebSocket APIs.
* Building a simple chat server and client.
* Rooms, broadcasting, and handling presence.
 


## 🗓️ Week 17 – Postgres & SQL Databases
- Explored **PostgreSQL** and relational database concepts.
- Learned about tables, primary keys, and relationships.
- Practiced writing **SQL queries**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Connected a Node.js backend with a Postgres database using **pg** library.

---

## 🗓️ Week 18 – Prisma & ORMs
- Introduced to **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** and how Prisma simplifies DB operations.
- Learned Prisma schema modeling and migrations.
- Connected Prisma to a Postgres database.
- Performed CRUD operations through Prisma Client.

---

## 🗓️ Week 19 – Next.js
- Started learning **Next.js** for full-stack React development.
- Understood file-based routing and API routes.
- Learned about **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **SSG (Static Site Generation)**.
- Built simple pages using `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`.

---

## 🗓️ Week 20 – Next.js (Advanced)
- Continued working with **Next.js** and integrated backend APIs.
- Used environment variables and dynamic routes.
- Implemented client-side data fetching using **SWR** and `fetch()`.
- Deployed a sample Next.js project to **Vercel**.
